## Styling
All components and views are created from scratch, styled using **Tailwind CSS**, and based on the native elements

## Storage
To persist data required for the application to run the project uses:
- `Pinia` - the new "go-to" state management library introduced by the Vue.js
- `Local Storage (with the Pinia Data Persistence Plugin)` - allows the Pinia stores to be serialized and persisted. This way, the available state data can be accessed after a refresh or browser tab close event.

Currently the storage has the following stores:
- `tvShows` - stores and manages the TV shows fetched from an external API


#### Data Fetching
In order to fetch the countries data the project uses the native [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
